This is a packaging of the project "Android PDF Viewer" (http://andpdf.sourceforge.net/) into a reusable library to make PDF viewing easier from within your Android application.

Consistent with the Android PDF Viewer project, the licensing for the PdfViewer project is LGPL

This code uses PhotoView from https://github.com/chrisbanes/PhotoView


This is a try to port over all the previous changes and merge with my personal local changes...

This is a packaging of the project "Android PDF Viewer" (http://andpdf.sourceforge.net/) into a reusable library to make PDF viewing easier from within your Android application.

Consistent with the Android PDF Viewer project, the licensing for the PdfViewer project is LGPL

This code uses PhotoView from https://github.com/chrisbanes/PhotoView

=======
UPDATES

This is a try to port over all the previous changes and merge with my personal local changes...
* The code may not compile until i finish to import everything
* The merging can lead to strange behaviours, if you see one, try the [starting fork](https://github.com/cwbowron/Android-Pdf-Viewer-Library) and if it works, put an issue here
* Remember to attach the PDF, the resulting behaviour (if graphic glitches), the logcat and all the information about device and android version in case of issue.

All the issues with no information and that cannot be reproduced, will be closed with no notification.
Thank you for your help!
